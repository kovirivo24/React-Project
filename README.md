# BryanCheng's Website
Welcome to my website! This is a little project I am working on while I learn React. 
I am also using this oportunity to teach myself HTML, CSS and Javascript. It has gone through a lot of changes since it started. Right now, it uses basic HTML and CSS code. 

### Usage  
**Go to https://bragor77.github.io/React-Project/** 

### Future Plans
- Make a mobile version of this website
- Add more content about myself
- Explore more features of React
